# This is my code in solving LeetCode 648: Replace Words

To solve this problem, we need to replace words in a sentence with the shortest root word from a given dictionary. The solution involves the following steps:

- Sort the dictionary: This helps to find the shortest possible root easily, as the shortest roots will appear earlier.
- Process each word in the sentence: For each word, we will check if it starts with any of the roots in the dictionary.
- Replace with the shortest root: If a word starts with multiple roots, the first match (shortest root due to sorting) will replace the word.

## This is my code
```
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def replaceWords(self, dictionary: List[str], sentence: str) -> str:
        # sort dictionary by length of the roots for shortest root replacement
        dictionary.sort(key=len)
        
        # split the sentence into words
        words = sentence.split()
        
        # iterate over each word in the sentence
        for i in range(len(words)):
            word = words[i]
            for root in dictionary:
                # check if the current word starts with the root
                if word.startswith(root):
                    # replace the word with the root
                    words[i] = root
                    break  # stop checking once the shortest root is found
        
        # join the modified words back into a sentence
        return ' '.join(words)


solution = Solution()
print(solution.replaceWords(["cat","bat","rat"], "the cattle was rattled by the battery"))  # Output will be "the cat was rat by the bat"
print(solution.replaceWords(["a","b","c"], "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"))  # Output will be "a a b c"
```

# Explanation

### Sorting the Dictionary:

- We sort the dictionary by the length of the roots using dictionary.sort(key=len). This ensures that when we iterate over the roots to find a match, the shortest roots are checked first.

### Splitting the Sentence:

- The sentence is split into individual words using sentence.split(). This allows us to process each word separately.

### Replacing Words with Roots:

- We iterate over each word in the sentence. For each word, we check if it starts with any of the roots in the sorted dictionary.
- If a match is found (using word.startswith(root)), we replace the word with this root and break out of the loop. This ensures that we replace the word with the shortest possible root.

### Reconstructing the Sentence:

- After processing all words, we join them back into a single string using ' '.join(words). This gives us the modified sentence where words are replaced by their respective roots.

This approach is efficient and ensures that the shortest root is used for replacement, as required by the problem constraints.
